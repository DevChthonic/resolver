All things problems.

# ⭐️ STARpad

**STARpad** is a lightweight web app for structured problem-solving using a tactical version of the STAR method:

- **S** – Sit Rep (Situation Report)  
- **T** – Tactics to Resolve  
- **A** – Actionable Steps  
- **R** – Reporting

It’s designed for developers, students, and anyone who needs a fast, clear framework for solving problems, logging thought processes, or learning from experience.
